#Password Generator
This password generator is a simple, terminal based.
using random,string,copyclipboard
I am not sure if it does work on other Operating systems rather than Ubuntu

I have built it with the following logic:
- Get the number of charcters that the user want
- Set an empty list
- Get what type of charcters the user want
- Fill that list based on those choices
- Return the list and ask the user if he wants to copy the password
- if yes Copy the password

##Future To Add
In the future I want to add:
-A config file to set the value of copying and possibly the choices
-an argument to ignore the config file
-A simple web app
-Implement this into the password manager project
-and maybe even build this to a package that you can download that is compatible in all OS
